# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project
#### --  Coursera Data Science Specialization Course Project  --
## Project Description
This project is the courese required exercise in acquiring and cleaning data. The project uses data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Human Activity Recognition and Smart Phone Data site (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Data for the project can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The end result of the tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This requires:
-	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
-	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
-	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-	From the data set above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Project Files
This repository holds the following files:
README.md – this file. 
CodeBook.md – it describes how to use the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data. 
cleandata-wk4.R – it contains the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps.
tidy_dataset.txt - The output of the project created by the execution of cleandata-wk.R
